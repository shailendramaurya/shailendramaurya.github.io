Hey !
Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

By day, I’m a full-time medico, and by night (or whenever I find a spare moment), I tinker with code and computers.

I build projects mostly for myself—so no open source... fow now!
Full-stack development, self-hosting and tinkering with networks keeps me entertained.

Oh, and before you scroll away—have you had your water today? Stay hydrated!


You can find me on,
